**LIFO behavior:**

* **Push:** Adds a new element to the "top" of the stack.
* **Pop:** Removes and returns the element from the "top" of the stack.

This maintains Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order in both implementations.

**Differences in element access:**

* **Slice version:**
    * Elements are added to the **end** of the underlying slice using `append`.
    * The "top" element is considered the **rightmost** element in the slice.
    * We access the "top" element by indexing the slice with `len(s) - 1`.
* **Linked list version:**
    * New elements are added at the **beginning** of the linked list by modifying the `head` pointer.
    * The "top" element is the **first node** (pointed to by the `head`).
    * We access the "top" element directly through the `head` pointer.

**Key point:**

While the way we access the "top" element differs due to the data structures' internal organization, the push and pop operations still follow the same LIFO principle in both implementations.  The element added last is the first one removed.
